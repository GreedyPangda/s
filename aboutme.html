<div style="left: 650px; position: absolute; top: 250px;">My name is Zuozheng Chen. Joe is my English name which I choose after arrive America. I was born in the Hegang city, Heilongjiang pro, China, where could arrive Russia about an hour,1995. I moved to them south part year by year, and now I lived in Shenzhen, where makes me miss the snow.  I come here for my second bachelor. My first major is automatic engineering, and I am working on management now.
    I don’t have so much working experience. My first job was got during my college study. It was a server in a restaurant, about 5 months. During that time, I was found by a market developer and become his assistance，maybe apprentice is more likely what I did that time. This work is not hard to learn but have a real difficulty to active. From the time, I found that I like business maybe, which lead me here.</div>
